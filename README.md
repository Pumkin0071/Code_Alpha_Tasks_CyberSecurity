# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è CodeAlpha Network Sniffer

A modern, interactive Python tool for exploring and analyzing network traffic in real time.  
Easily capture, inspect, and log packets with a vibrant, user-friendly terminal interface.

---

## üåü Highlights

- **Real-Time Capture:** Instantly view packets as they appear on your network.
- **Multi-Protocol Support:** Handles TCP, UDP, ICMP, and more.
- **Vivid Terminal Output:** Uses color to distinguish protocols and warnings.
- **Live Protocol Stats:** See protocol counts as you capture.
- **Flexible Interface Selection:** Choose your network interface (Linux).
- **Protocol Filtering:** Focus on TCP, UDP, or ICMP traffic as needed.
- **CSV Logging:** Save packet summaries for later analysis.
- **Hex & ASCII Views:** Examine both raw and readable payloads.
- **Cross-Platform:** Works on Linux and Windows (admin/root required).
- **Easy to Extend:** Clean, well-commented code for learning and customization.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### 1. Requirements

No extra packages needed‚Äîjust Python 3.x.

### 2. Launching the Sniffer

```bash
# On Linux (run as root)
sudo python3 "Basic Network Sniffer.py" [options]

# On Windows (run as Administrator)
python "Basic Network Sniffer.py" [options]
```

### 3. Command-Line Options

| Option              | Purpose                                         |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `-c`, `--count`     | Limit the number of packets captured           |
| `-p`, `--protocol`  | Filter by protocol: `tcp`, `udp`, or `icmp`    |
| `-i`, `--interface` | Specify network interface (Linux only)         |
| `-l`, `--log`       | Save packet details to a CSV file              |

#### Usage Examples

```bash
# Capture 10 TCP packets on eth0 and save to packets.csv
sudo python3 "Basic Network Sniffer.py" -c 10 -p tcp -i eth0 -l packets.csv

# Capture all packets on the default interface
sudo python3 "Basic Network Sniffer.py"
```

## üîí Permissions & Notes

- **Linux:** Run as `root` (use `sudo`).
- **Windows:** Run as Administrator.
- If you encounter permission errors, check your privileges.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

- Uses ANSI codes for colorful output.
- Parses Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP headers.
- Displays live protocol statistics.
- Modular and easy to expand for new features.
